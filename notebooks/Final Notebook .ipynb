    "This Notebook contains steps to classify text to predict the Meyers Briggs Type of the person who wrote the text. The goal is build a accurate model that can be used to group people based on these types. In order to do this a large amount of data cleaning most take place as well as standard steps that most be taken while doing a text classification model. I used a TF-IDF score and count vectorizer in each of my models to measure how important each word was in the corpus. I used a few models to test out which scores came out the best before settling on a final model. I'll give a summary of each section and provide a link to each individual notebook.   "

    "The head of human resources (HRD) and the CEO at Cartex is starting a new initiative to have small group meetings before the start of each work day. The meetings will be casual and have a few questions each day dealing with work related and un work related matters. The human resources head wants to make sure that the workers are grouped with people who are different then them. IE maybe not the first person they would sit down with at lunch. The question is then how could they get information on the employees to group them? The HRD decides against using a questionnaire as most of the time employees tend to be untruthful with them and Cartex had already tried a program with a questionnaire that did meet the companies standards. The HRD decides to use the Meyers Briggs test as a way to group the employees but does not want the employees to waste time taking the test. He decides to ask the CEO what to do. The CEO recommends talking to the recently formed data science team. The data science team comes up with a plan to create machine learning models to classify employee internet posts and predict their Meyers Briggs score. The employees are aware of the plan and submit their social media links to the data science team. They decide to use a few different models to test and from that can pick a final model to give a solid prediction of each employees’ Meyers Briggs score."

    "The data set is from Kaggle and is contained in one file. It contains over 8600 rows containing two columns of a person’s Meyers Briggs code/type and a section of the last 50 things they have posted on an online internet forum. The posts are separated by ‘|||’. The 16 types of personalities are made from 4 axis personality types: \n",
    "-\tIntroversion (I) – Extroversion (E)\n",
    "-\tIntuition (N) – Sensing (S)\n",
    "-\tThinking (T) – Feeling (F)\n",
    "-\tJudging (J) – Perceiving (P)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the 4 axis types you build a 4-letter type, for example ESTJ. Since there are 4 axes for each letter there are 16 potential MBTIs (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) in the data set. The MBTI has been overshadowed by other methods of measuring personality but it is still regarded as a useful tool in the psychological community.  This data is also very imbalanced as most of the people collected are introverted and intuitive so that will have to be addressed when preparing to model and while modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential personalities are:\n",
    "1.\tISTJ: Quiet, serious, earn success by thoroughness and dependability\n",
    "2.\tISFJ: Quiet, friendly, responsible, and conscientious\n",
    "3.\tINFJ: Seek meaning and connection in ideas, relationships, and material possessions\n",
    "4.\tINTJ: Have original minds and great drive for implementing their ideas and achieving their goals\n",
    "5.\tISTP: Tolerant and flexible, quiet observers until a problem appears, then act quickly to find workable solutions\n",
    "6.\tISFP: Quiet, friendly, sensitive, and kind.\n",
    "7.\tINFP: Idealistic, loyal to their values and to people who are important to them\n",
    "8.\tINTP: Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them\n",
    "9.\tESTP: Flexible and tolerant, they take a pragmatic approach focused on immediate results\n",
    "10.\tESFP: Outgoing, friendly, and accepting\n",
    "11.\tENFP: Warmly enthusiastic and imaginative\n",
    "12.\tENTP: Quick, ingenious, stimulating, alert, and outspoken\n",
