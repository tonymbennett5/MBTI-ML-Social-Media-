## Business Problem 
The Meyers Briggs test is used by individuals to classify a persons pesonality. In this project we are seeing if a machine model could be built to predict someones personality and what personlities can be predicted based on the features of the social media text. An head of hr wants to be able to group people based on their scores so the model would have practical application.    

## Data Understanding
The data set is from Kaggle and is contained in one file. It contains over 8600 rows containing two columns of a person’s Meyers Briggs code/type and a section of the last 50 things they have posted on an online internet forum. The posts are separated by ‘|||’.
